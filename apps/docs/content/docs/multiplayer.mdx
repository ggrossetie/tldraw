<Callout icon="⚠️">

This is an early preview of multiplayer in tldraw. It's not yet suitable for production.
If you're interested, come chat to us in [#sync on Discord](https://discord.gg/TNqHbu5mHv).

</Callout>

Tldraw supports a collaborative multiplayer experience out of the box. Changes to a document can by
synced in real-time to other instances, including presence information like live cursors to show the
activities of other collaborators.

## Try multiplayer in your own app

The easiest way to start experimenting with multiplayer is with the `useMultiplayerDemo` hook from
`@tldraw/sync`. This hook connects to our `demo.tldrawsync.com` multiplayer server, which hosts
multiplayer rooms for 1 day and can be used to prototype a collaborative experience on tldraw quickly,
but should not be used in production.

Start by installing @tldraw/sync:

```
npm install @tldraw/sync
```

Then, in your app, call the `useMultiplayerDemo` hook with a room ID. It'll return a
[`store`](/docs/persistence#The-store-prop) that you can pass into the tldraw component:

```tsx
function MyApp() {
	const store = useMultiplayerDemo({ roomId: 'myApp-abc123' })
	return <Tldraw store={store} />
}
```

Make sure the room ID is unique. The namespace is shared by everyone using the demo server. Consider
prefixing it with your company or project name.
